When Lori Hinytz joined Charger Robotics, the team needed organization, discipline, and help with marketing. She was then lovingly and respectfully dubbed “Hinytz,” and in 2006 became the faculty adviser for our team. She completed her undergraduate work at Carroll College in History with a minor in Social Studies and Geography, and an emphasis in Russian Studies. Since then she has earned a Master’s Degree in Technology Education from Marian University. She loves working with such a diverse group of students, watching them learn and grow. Hinytz is the driving force in the machine we call Charger Robotics.

Taylor Woods joined Charger Robotics because her older brother was on the team, and she had been helping at competitions for three years. This inspired her to join the team when she became a student at Hamilton High School. As an alumnus from the class of 2010, she became a part time marketing mentor. After graduating from University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh in 2014 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, she became a full time mentor. Taylor’s favorite part of robotics is seeing the look of accomplishment on the students faces during competition. She is also a member of the Wisconsin Regional Planning Committee, where she writes the newsletter “Bot Bytes.”

Jon is in the Electrical CDT, but he’s always willing to help out where needed. Jon started with 537 in the fall of 2013. He had the opportunity to see several First competitions over the years, and was always impressed by the robots a group of high school students could produce in 6 weeks. Being an engineer, he was glad to get the opportunity to help 537 and pass along whatever he can to the students, and help them have fun along the way. Jon has been involved in product development for over 25 years, and currently leads a cross functional team of development engineers producing automation equipment – not that different than the robos team. He feels, the adults have a lot of the same problems as the students in working through a project! Jon has a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UW-Madison, and an M.B.A. from Marquette University. He is also an outdoors guy, and gets in as much fishing and hunting as his busy schedule allows.

                <p>I attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison and received a Bachelors of Science in Mechanical Engineering.  I immediately started working for GE Healthcare (then GE Medical Systems) in 1999 as a design engineer.

I went for the pizza, and fell in love with the program.  I offered up my Alma Mater, Sussex-Hamilton High School, as our flagship school to try this FIRST thing out.  The rest is history.</p>

                <b>What is your favorite thing about being a mentor for team 537?</b>
                <p>My favorite thing about mentoring for FIRST is seeing the excitement the students show when they see for the first time something they created work on the field.  Also, to see students that I have mentored come back with successful jobs, and decide to share the knowledge they have learned with a new generation of students by becoming mentors themselves.</p>

David Wechter is the mechanical fabrication and assembly mentor for Team 537. “Justin, my son, was on the team beginning in 2004, and I saw what a great program it was for high school students.

David earned his Bachelor’s Degree of Engineering and Technology from Rochester Institute of Technology. He also obtained a Master’s Degree of Science and Engineering Management from MSOE, while obtaining a “Lean Masters” at Rockwell University.
His favorite part of robotics is the new skills the students, who “mature” through the aspects of the program, are taught, such as how to compete “graciously”. He enjoys seeing students help other teams once they learn the skills. In addition, David Wechter volunteers at various FIRST Regional events, including Wisconsin, as the Field Supervisor, queuing, and for field assembly and repair, and as a “junior achievement” teacher for Amy Bell school students.

<h4>Jon Beimborn</h4>
<p><strong>Years With Team:</strong> 2013 – Present<br />
Jon is in the Electrical CDT, but he’s always willing to help out where needed. Jon started with 537 in the fall of 2013. He had the opportunity to see several First competitions over the years, and was always impressed by the robots a group of high school students could produce in 6 weeks. Being an engineer, he was glad to get the opportunity to help 537 and pass along whatever he can to the students, and help them have fun along the way. Jon has been involved in product development for over 25 years, and currently leads a cross functional team of development engineers producing automation equipment &#8211; not that different than the robos team. He feels, the adults have a lot of the same problems as the students in working through a project! Jon has a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from UW-Madison, and an M.B.A. from Marquette University. He is also an outdoors guy, and gets in as much fishing and hunting as his busy schedule allows.<br />

His favorite part of robotics is building a working robot, using different parts. He loves to have fun, but teaching and solving problems are his main focus when he is here. During the Mini Regional, Rich Coe is a huge asset due to his experience with computer networking. He also volunteers at the FRC Wisconsin Regional along with other regionals such as Minnesota North Star, Indiana Crossroads, and Lake Superior.</p>
